  abstract = {Of all the tasks related to bus station management, one of the most
	important decisions that greatly affects the quality of the service
	is the assignment of platforms. A bad assignment procedure may be
	uncomfortable for frequent passengers who often suffer changes in
	departure gates, or may even be affected by the lack of platforms.
	Assignment is complicated due to the frequent incidents that cause
	delays in or the moving forward of services (with the corresponding
	changes in assignment), and to increases in services that convert
	the platforms into a limited resource. Even though this problem of
	platform assignment has been studied in more detail in the field
	of airport terminals, the difficulties in road transportation are
	both distinct and significant. In this paper we develop an intelligent
	system employing rule-based models for the daily management of the
	platforms of a bus station. The developed system is currently being
	used in a real bus station with more than 1,000 daily services.}

	a passenger terminal building and a given set of aircraft (with associated
	numbers of arriving and departing passengers), a method to find aircraft
	stand assignment which minimizes average passenger walking distances
	is proposed. The method is based on a branch\&bound technique (backtracking
	version), slightly modified to accelerate computation. This type
	of optimization is to be applied only if the number of passengers
	varies enough between the aircraft in question. The optimum solution
	mainly affected the number of passengers who walk maximum distances
	(decreased this number) and minimum distances (increased this number),
	compared to random aircraft stand assignment.}

	schedule analysis methods were proposed to evaluate the crew friendliness
	of a schedule for a given fleet. (2) To meet the computational challenges
	of crew scheduling in integrated planning, a duty flow model was

	is a central part of the planning process for a railway company.
	This paper reviews models and methods that have been proposed in
	the literature to assist planners in finding train routes. Since
	the problem of routing trains on a railway network entails allocating
	the track capacity of the network (or part thereof) over time in
	a conflict-free manner, all studies that model railway track allocation
	in some capacity are considered relevant. We hence survey work on
	the train timetabling, train dispatching, train platforming, and
	train routing problems, group them by railway network type, and discuss
	track allocation from a strategic, tactical, and operational level.},

  title = {A Solution Approach for Planning Problems under Stochastic Disturbances},
  school = {Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University, Chungli
	32054, Taiwan, ROC},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {There are many stochastic factors that will affect the performance
	of the planning results in a passenger transportation system, such
	as passenger demands, vehicular travel times and flight delays. Past
	traditional deterministic models have been established based on the
	average values of factors such as input to obtain optimal solutions.
	However, such stochastic factors during the operational stage could
	have a significant influence on the planning results. An optimal
	plan might therefore lose its optimality when applied in real world
	operations where stochastic disturbances occur. In addition, most
	stochastic disturbance planning problems have been handled in two
	separate stages, the planning and the real-time stages. Most past
	research on these types of problems has focused on improving real-time
	adjustments to stochastic disturbances. In this research however
	we try to develop an integrated framework that combines both the
	planning and the simulated real-time stages together. The framework
	is expected to be useful for solving for better planning solutions
	to stochastic disturbance problems.
	
	To evaluate how the proposed framework performs in practice, we perform
	applications to both gate assignment and inter-city bus scheduling
	problems. The dissertation includes three essays. In the first, we
	consider the stochastic characteristics of flight delays in actual
	operations; we integrate both the planning and the simulated real-time
	stages together to solve for gate assignment plans flexible enough
	to meet stochastic disturbances. In the second essay, we consider
	the bus scheduling planning problem with stochastic bus travel times.
	We develop an integrated framework that can systematically analyze
	planned bus scheduling and simulated real-time schedule adjustment
	problems in order to help the inter-city bus carriers plan suitable
	bus routes/schedules. The third essay considers the stochastic passenger
	demands, the variable market shares and the stochastic bus travel
	times of real world operations to develop a multi-stochastic bus
	scheduling model. Simulated real-time schedule adjustment is also
	incorporated into the framework. The result is to produce a better
	bus route/schedule plan. We performed these applications using real
	operational data, with reasonable simplifications. We used the C
	computer language to write the necessary programs, coupled with the
	CPLEX mathematical programming solver, to solve the problems. Finally,
	conclusions and suggestions are given.},

	the airport authority needs to reassign flights to different gates
	in real-time. The traditional manual flight reassignment method is
	neither efficient nor effective in cases with variable flight delay
	information, and the reassignment is frequently time constrained.
	Consequently, in this study the goal is to develop a gate reassignment
	framework, and a systematic computerized tool, for repeatedly handling
	gate reassignments given varied flight delay information. The results
	of a test case related to Taiwan international airport operations,
	show that the proposed framework performs well.},
