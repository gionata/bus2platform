  abstract = {Of all the tasks related to bus station management, one of the most
	important decisions that greatly affects the quality of the service
	is the assignment of platforms. A bad assignment procedure may be
	uncomfortable for frequent passengers who often suffer changes in
	departure gates, or may even be affected by the lack of platforms.
	Assignment is complicated due to the frequent incidents that cause
	delays in or the moving forward of services (with the corresponding
	changes in assignment), and to increases in services that convert
	the platforms into a limited resource. Even though this problem of
	platform assignment has been studied in more detail in the field
	of airport terminals, the difficulties in road transportation are
	both distinct and significant. In this paper we develop an intelligent
	system employing rule-based models for the daily management of the
	platforms of a bus station. The developed system is currently being
	used in a real bus station with more than 1,000 daily services.}

	GATES is a constraint-satisfaction expert system. To make its decisions,
	it uses two types of production rule: permissive rules and conflict
	rules. Permissive rules determine when it's appropriate to consider
	a particular gate for a particular flight, and permit the system
	to search the next level of rules to obtain an assignment. Conflict
	rules determine when particular flights cannot be assigned to particular
	gates. System operators can modify schedules by retracting rules,
	adjusting tolerances, and deleting information. The system was developed
	for a PC, thereby providing an efficient and flexible user environment.
	The approach is extensible to various engineering and industrial
	problems where limited resources and weakly defined constraints exist

	A lot of different parties are involved with this, each of which

	that the 'Regie' at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is responsible
	for, are the gate assignment problem (i.e. where to place which aircraft)
	and the bus assignment problem (i.e. which bus will transport which
	passengers to or from the aircraft). Currently these two problems
	are solved in a sequential fashion, the output of the gate assignment
	problem is used as input for the bus assignment problem. We look
	at integrating these two sequential problems into one larger problem
	that considers both problems at the same time. This creates the possibility
	of using information regarding the bus assignment problem while solving
	the gate assignment problem. We developed a column generation algorithm
	for this problem and have implemented a prototype. To make the algorithm
	efficient we used a special technique called stabilized column generation
	and also column deletion. Computational experiments with real-life
	data from AAS indicate that our algorithm is able to compute a planning
	for one day at Schiphol in a reasonable time.},

	The research focus was to integrate fleet assignment and crew scheduling,

	The contributions include: (1) To understand how schedule development
	and fleet assignment stages influence crew scheduling performance,
	schedule analysis methods were proposed to evaluate the crew friendliness
	of a schedule for a given fleet. (2) To meet the computational challenges
	of crew scheduling in integrated planning, a duty flow model was

	(3) A new robust crew scheduling method based on spoke purity was

	(4) By imposing station purity, an integrated and robust planning

	separate stages, the planning and the real-time stages. Most past
	research on these types of problems has focused on improving real-time
	adjustments to stochastic disturbances. In this research however
	we try to develop an integrated framework that combines both the
	planning and the simulated real-time stages together. The framework
	is expected to be useful for solving for better planning solutions
	to stochastic disturbance problems.
	
	To evaluate how the proposed framework performs in practice, we perform
	applications to both gate assignment and inter-city bus scheduling
	problems. The dissertation includes three essays. In the first, we
	consider the stochastic characteristics of flight delays in actual
	operations; we integrate both the planning and the simulated real-time
	stages together to solve for gate assignment plans flexible enough
	to meet stochastic disturbances. In the second essay, we consider
	the bus scheduling planning problem with stochastic bus travel times.
	We develop an integrated framework that can systematically analyze
	planned bus scheduling and simulated real-time schedule adjustment
	problems in order to help the inter-city bus carriers plan suitable
	bus routes/schedules. The third essay considers the stochastic passenger
	demands, the variable market shares and the stochastic bus travel
	times of real world operations to develop a multi-stochastic bus
	scheduling model. Simulated real-time schedule adjustment is also
	incorporated into the framework. The result is to produce a better
	bus route/schedule plan. We performed these applications using real
	operational data, with reasonable simplifications. We used the C
	computer language to write the necessary programs, coupled with the
	CPLEX mathematical programming solver, to solve the problems. Finally,
	conclusions and suggestions are given.},

	The maximal cliques of an interval graph contain important structural
	information. Many problems on interval graphs can be solved after
	all the maximal cliques are known. It is shown that cut vertices,
	bridges, and vertex connectivities can all be determined easily after
	the maximal cliques are known. Finally, the all-pair shortest path

	maximal cliques. The all-pair shortest path algorithm can also be
