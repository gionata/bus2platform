ToDo list.

= High priority =

  * Modify the _c_{ij} to divide the time horizon in smaller slots such that the _c_{ij} = 0 if _i_ belongs to slot _m_ and _j_ belongs to _n_, _|n - m| > 1_. The idea is to use <wiki:gadget url="http://mathml-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mathml-gadget.xml" border="0" up_content="e^{ - \beta d(i, j) }"/> where <wiki:gadget url="http://mathml-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mathml-gadget.xml" border="0" up_content="\beta = 0.25"/> and time is measured in minutes.



  * Divide the instance in sub-instances. Each sub-instance contains the dwells within the time-horizon, the dwells in the previous time-horizon (if it exists), the "corse-bis" related dwells. When the models are genereted the lower buond of the already assigned dwells will be put to 1 (forcing the variable to the constant value 1).

  * ...


= Medium Priority =

  * Add the "adjacency constraints" for "corse bis".
